Panobbgo User Guide
===================

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for **Panobbgo** (Parallel Noisy Black-Box Global Optimization).

This guide provides everything you need to understand, use, and extend Panobbgo for your black-box optimization problems.

Overview
--------

Panobbgo is a flexible, modular Python framework for optimizing expensive black-box functions where:

- You can only evaluate the function, not analyze its internal structure
- Evaluations may be noisy or stochastic
- You have a limited evaluation budget
- You can leverage parallel computing resources
- You may have box constraints and constraint violations

The framework uses an **event-driven architecture** with multiple point generation **heuristics**
that are coordinated by an adaptive **strategy** implementing a **multi-armed bandit** approach.

Key Concepts
------------

Before diving in, here are the core concepts you'll encounter throughout Panobbgo:

**Problem**
   The black-box function you want to minimize, defined by its dimensionality and bounding box

**Point**
   A candidate solution (location in search space) generated by a heuristic

**Result**
   The outcome of evaluating a Point, including objective value and constraint violations

**Heuristic**
   A point generation strategy (e.g., random sampling, local search, model-based)

**Analyzer**
   A module that processes results and maintains derived information (e.g., best points, spatial decomposition)

**Strategy**
   The orchestrator that coordinates heuristics, manages evaluation, and tracks the optimization budget

**EventBus**
   The communication backbone enabling decoupled interaction between modules

**Multi-Armed Bandit**
   The adaptive selection mechanism that learns which heuristics work well for your problem

Typical Workflow
----------------

A typical Panobbgo workflow looks like this:

1. **Define your problem** by subclassing :class:`~panobbgo.lib.lib.Problem`

   .. code-block:: python

      class MyProblem(Problem):
          def eval(self, x):
              return my_expensive_function(x)

2. **Choose a strategy** (typically :class:`~panobbgo.strategies.rewarding.StrategyRewarding`)

   .. code-block:: python

      strategy = StrategyRewarding(problem, max_evaluations=1000)

3. **Add heuristics** to create a diverse portfolio

   .. code-block:: python

      strategy.add(Center)
      strategy.add(LatinHypercube, div=5)
      strategy.add(Random)
      strategy.add(NelderMead)

4. **Run optimization** (requires IPython cluster)

   .. code-block:: python

      strategy.start()

5. **Analyze results**

   .. code-block:: python

      print(f"Best found: {strategy.best}")
      df = strategy.results.results

Design Philosophy
-----------------

Panobbgo's design is guided by several principles:

**Modularity**
   Components are independent and interchangeable. Add, remove, or replace heuristics without affecting others.

**Extensibility**
   Easy to add custom heuristics, analyzers, or strategies by subclassing base classes.

**Composability**
   Mix and match components to create custom optimization workflows.

**Event-Driven**
   Loose coupling through the EventBus—modules communicate without direct dependencies.

**Parallel-First**
   Built for distributed evaluation on IPython clusters from the ground up.

**Research-Oriented**
   Designed for experimentation and prototyping new optimization ideas.

When to Use Panobbgo
---------------------

Panobbgo excels when you have:

✓ Expensive function evaluations (seconds to hours per evaluation)

✓ No access to gradients or derivatives

✓ Noisy or stochastic evaluations

✓ Box-constrained search space

✓ Optional constraint violations to minimize

✓ Parallel computing resources available

✓ A research or experimental mindset (willing to tune and customize)

Common application domains include:

- Hyperparameter optimization for machine learning
- Simulation calibration and parameter estimation
- Engineering design optimization (aerodynamics, structures, etc.)
- Scientific model fitting
- Industrial process optimization

When NOT to Use Panobbgo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider alternatives if you have:

✗ Access to gradients (use gradient-based methods instead)

✗ Cheap function evaluations (simple methods may suffice)

✗ Convex problems with known structure (use convex optimization)

✗ Very high dimensions (>50) without special structure

✗ Need for out-of-the-box production-ready solver (Panobbgo is research-oriented)

System Requirements
-------------------

- Python ≥ 3.8
- NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, IPython
- IPython parallel cluster for distributed evaluation
- Tested on Linux and macOS (Windows should work but less tested)
