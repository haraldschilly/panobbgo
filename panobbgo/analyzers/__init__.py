Analyzers
=========

Analyzers, just like :mod:`.heuristics`, listen to events
and change their internal state based on local and
global data. They can emit :class:`events <panobbgo.core.Event>`
on their own and they are accessible via the
:meth:`~panobbgo.core.StrategyBase.analyzer` method of
the strategy.
