Heuristics
==========
The main idea behind all heuristics is, ...

Each heuristic needs to listen to at least one stream of
:class:`Events <panobbgo.core.Event>` from the :class:`~panobbgo.core.EventBus`.
Most likely, it is the `one-shot` event ``start``, which is
:meth:`published <panobbgo.core.EventBus.publish>` by the
:class:`~panobbgo.core.StrategyBase`.
