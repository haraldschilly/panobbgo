    r'''
    This heuristic is inspired by the
    `Nelder Mead Method <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method>`_

    Algorithm:

    * If there are enough result points available, it tries to find a
      subset of points, which are linear independent (hence, suiteable for NM)
      and have the best (so far) function values, and are
      close (in the same :class:`Box <panobbgo.analyzers.Splitter>`).

    * Then, it applies the NM heuristic in a randomized fashion, i.e. it generates
      several promising points into the same direction as
      the implied search direction. See :meth:`here <.nelder_mead>`.
