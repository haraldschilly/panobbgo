Strategies
==========

This part outlines the coordination between the point-producing
heuristics, the interaction with the cluster and the
:class:`DB of evaluated points <panobbgo.core.Results>`.

Basically, one or more threads produce points where to search,
and another one consumes them and dispatches tasks.
Subclass the :class:`~panobbgo.core.StrategyBase` class to implement
a new strategy.
